## Description
This application is actually a question and answer game that you can use and enjoy with different settings. These settings include the level of difficulty of the questions, their number and the topic of the questions. There are also other special settings embedded in the game, which I suggest you experience the game to see. Other things such as resetting the general settings of the game, creating a character and changing the theme can also be adjusted in the game. Also, in the game history section, you can access comprehensive information about all the games you have played in detail.

I hope you enjoy and look forward to your contributions!
